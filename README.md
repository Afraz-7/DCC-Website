## Upload to MySQL
Data was uploaded to MySQL using the Table Data Import Wizard. This indicates that data from a source, possibly the converted files or another dataset, was transferred into a MySQL database. The following steps were taken:

1. *Step 1: Select File*
This step involves selecting the file that contains the data to be imported into MySQL. Users are typically prompted to browse their file system to locate and select the desired file.
